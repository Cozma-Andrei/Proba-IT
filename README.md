# React Template

## Informations
- This repository contains a basic react app using TypeScript
- It has been created using `npm create vite@latest`

## How to run

0. You should check that you have the latest releases on npm and node; this can be done using:
    - `sudo n stable`
    - `sudo npm install -g npm@latest`
1. `cd frontend`
2. `npm install`
3. `npm run dev`

## Docker <3

Since installing dependencies is sometimes the worst thing to do, we prepared for you a docker
container too, which actually lets you do the same work, but without always needing to `npm install`

The way to use it is simple:
1. Install docker
2. `sudo docker-compose up`
3. Continue to code
